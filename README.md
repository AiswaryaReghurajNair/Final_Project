# Final_Project
## Overview of Problem Statement:
Student depression is a critical issue affecting academic performance, relationships, and overall well-being. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze factors contributing to depression and identify students at risk. This program aims to provide actionable insights to guide interventions and mental health strategies.
## Objective
*Identify significant factors influencing student depression.
*Predict the likelihood of depression using machine learning models.
*Enhance awareness and provide data-driven support for mental health.
## Data Description
The dataset contains information about students, their demographics, behaviors, and potential indicators of depression. The datset is taken from Kaggle.
# Key features might include:
Demographics: Age, gender, educational level.
Lifestyle: Sleep patterns, study hours, social interaction.
Mental Health Indicators: Stress levels, reported symptoms, professional consultations.
Outcome Variable: Depression severity (e.g., binary or categorical labels like mild, moderate, severe).
